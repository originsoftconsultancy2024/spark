**K-Means Clustering On Pharmacies Using Spark**

Program loads the data from Pharmacies.csv into a spark resilient distributed dataset (RDD).
The program is made to train a model on assigning clusters based on the Zip Code column, that means clustering based on location.
The second file, Sample.csv, works as a training data for K-means Clustering.
The file is loaded, model is trained and applied on the main data and results are shown.
